1.  There is no guarantee of tests order in Junit.
    That's why we can not relies on it.
2.  In Junit e.g. we can call assertEquals with individual messege in 2 ways:
    a) send String
    b) send String Supplier
    We can send simple String by send a method which returns String but we have to remember this method will ALWAYS be executed.
    If we send Supplier the Supplier will be called ONLY if the test not pass.
